D_mel_transposon_sequence_set.fa
-----------------------------------

This file was used in [Sackton et al (2009)](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/449.full)
and was created by modifying the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project's TE data set (v9.4.1) to 
1) include the class/subclass of each family and 2) remove any TE sequences not from D. melanogaster. 
LTR elements are represented by a single entry. There are 128 entries in this file. This file is formatted to be compatible with RepeatMasker using the -lib option.
@20180321: ccwu update this file for correcting several error sequences.
